 **Interactive Airline Reviews Dashboard | Tableau Data Visualization Project**  
*Self-directed project | 2025*  
- Designed a dynamic **Tableau dashboard** to visualize and analyze British Airways customer reviews, with interactive filters and user-driven metrics.  
- Connected and prepared datasets (reviews and country data), established table relationships, and enabled continent-level filtering for geographic insights.  
- Created **interactive visuals** including maps, line charts, bar charts, and summary cards that respond to user inputs via filters (seat type, date, traveler type, aircraft, and more).  
- Implemented **parameter controls** for metric selection, enabling users to dynamically switch between KPIs such as Cabin Staff Service, Food, Entertainment, and Overall Ratings.  
- Applied **floating containers**, consistent styling, and customized tooltips to optimize layout, design clarity, and user experience.  
- Published the dashboard to **Tableau Public**, enabling public access and showcasing interactive data storytelling capabilities.
